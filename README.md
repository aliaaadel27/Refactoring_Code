My Advanced Blog
This is a simple, static blog project built using HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS. The project showcases a blog layout with multiple articles, a search bar, user comments, and a contact form.

Project Structure
The project has the following directory structure:
Breakdown of Files
index.html: Contains the structure of the blog, including the header, navigation bar, blog articles, comments section, and footer. Bootstrap is used for layout and responsiveness.
styles.css: Custom CSS styles used to override or enhance Bootstrapâ€™s default styles.
/assets: This folder is optional and can be used to store any images or other media files for the project.

How to Run the Project
Prerequisites
You just need a web browser to run the project. No additional dependencies are required.

Steps to Run:
Download or clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/aliaaadel27/Refactoring_Code.git
Open the project: Navigate to the directory where the project is located.

Run the project: Simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser by double-clicking it or right-clicking and selecting "Open with browser".

Features:
Responsive Navigation Bar: The navbar adjusts based on screen size (collapsible for mobile).
Blog Articles: Each article is styled using Bootstrap card components.
Comment Form: Users can leave feedback through a simple form under each article.
Contact Form: A basic contact form is located in the footer for user inquiries.
Back-to-Top Link: A link to scroll back to the top of the page.
Notes:
No backend is implemented in this version. The contact form and comment form actions are placeholders and need to be connected to a server or backend service to function.
The CSS for styles is loaded asynchronously to improve page performance.
Future Enhancements:
Adding a backend for managing blog posts and comments.
Implementing a dynamic blog post system using a database.
Adding more sections like a "Recent Posts" or "Popular Posts" widget.
