Point 5 in task 4: Performance and Loading:
- Optimize page loading (e.g., use appropriately sized
images, non-blocking CSS loading).

<---------------------------------------answer------------------------------------------------>
1-use appropriately sized images:
Using the srcset attribute allows to specify different
image sizes for different screen resolutions, so browser 
can select the most appropriate size, improving load times and performance.
Example:
<img src="image-small.jpg"   alt="Description of image" 
  srcset="
    image-small.jpg 600w, 
    image-medium.jpg 1200w, 
    image-large.jpg 1800w" 
  sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 
    (max-width: 1200px) 50vw,33vw" 
/> 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2-Asynchronous CSS Loading:
Using the media attribute combined with onload can achieve this. It initially sets the media type to print, which means 
the CSS won't apply until the page has loaded. The onload event then changes the media type to all, applying the styles.

3-Optimize JavaScript Loading
Using the defer attribute ensures that the script is downloaded in parallel with the HTML parsing but executed after the HTML
has been fully parsed.
This prevents JavaScript from blocking the rendering of the page and can significantly improve load times, especially if
script is large or if there are multiple scripts.
